## The Unified Namespace Manifesto

### A Framework for Scalable, Open, and Event-Driven Industry


## The Core Philosophy

A Unified Namespace (UNS) is a living, event-driven, structured data ecosystem that creates a (near) real-time, shared, contextualized understanding of operations.

It is a framework — not a tool.

Tools may enable it. But tools alone will never make it. It is human centered, and needs governance.


## Why a Unified Namespace Manifesto?

In 2001, the **Agile Manifesto** reshaped software development worldwide.
It was not a tool.
It was not a product.
It was not a standard.

It was a **set of principles**.

Today, industry, manufacturing, energy, logistics, and smart infrastructure need the same clarity.

The **Unified Namespace (UNS)** is not a product.
It is not a broker.
It is not a platform.

It is a **design philosophy for industrial information systems** which goes beyond the boundaries of IT and OT, as it spans across the entire extended organization (various providers, public institutions, B2B/B2C customers, etc.) to deliver Data as high value-added.

Like agility, it is:

* Difficult to explain in theory
* Obvious once experienced (Maria Montessori's #LearnByDoing principle)
* Simple in principle
* Powerful in practice
* Easy to misunderstand
* Hard to master, needs many years of hands-on fields experience (not theory)

You do not “install” a Unified Namespace.
You **design a Digital Strategy, and grow into it** over the years.

## The Four Principles of Unified Namespace

Inspired by the spirit of Agile, we value:

### 1️⃣ Event-Driven Architecture
**Over tightly coupled, brittle, spaghetti integrations**

Systems publish facts as they happen.
Consumers subscribe to what they need.
No more fragile point-to-point dependencies.

* **Edge Driven**: All devices and systems use events tracked and processed locally and globally, as per today the most widely used and proven approach is to use an MQTT 5.0 broker.
* **Resilience (Disconnected Mode)**: In disconnected mode (offline), the system must still work. When back online, it auto-resynchronizes by sending missing data (Store & Forward).

---

### 2️⃣ Report by Exception (RBE)
**Over massive, meaningless data floods**

Only meaningful changes matter.
Signal over noise.
Context over volume.

* **Anti-Polling**: Traditional architectures return all data periodically, even "Null" or "empty" data. This jams the network at scale and creates junk in data lakes. UNS eliminates this waste.

---

### 3️⃣ Lightweight & Scalable Design
**Over heavy, monolithic, non-scalable stacks**

Architecture must evolve with the business.
If it cannot scale horizontally and adapt quickly, it will collapse under complexity.

* **Lightweight Pub/Sub**: MQTT is not compulsory but is nearly a "Must Have" above Level 2. (OPC UA is the standard for L1/L2).
* **No REST API for Core**: REST APIs are used to talk *to* the UNS, but are not the center piece. The core is event-based.

---

### 4️⃣ Open & Interoperable Standards
**Over closed, proprietary lock-in**

Interoperability is sovereignty.
Open protocols enable resilience, innovation, and freedom of choice.

* **Open Architecture**: Systems must "play nice" with other actors and share data using standard tools.
* **Proven at Scale**: This is not for Proofs of Concept (PoC) that only work locally. It is proven to work at scale (1000+ sites worldwide in true production).

# Common mistakes and what UNS is NOT

* ❌ Not an MQTT broker alone
* ❌ Not a technology stack
* ❌ Not a data lake
* ❌ Not a dashboard
* ❌ Not an IIoT platform
* ❌ Not a vendor solution
* ❌ Not ...

It is the **architectural coherence** that connects systems and humans.


#  The Consequences of Doing It Right

When correctly implemented, a Unified Namespace creates:

### A Global Single Source of Truth (SSoT)
A shared, real-time operational reality across IT & OT.
* **Real-Time Definition**: It represents the *last known value* in near real-time.
* **No Duplication**: It provides data *without duplication* and *without storing it* (no database in the UNS core; historians are separate).
* **Automatic HMI**: New KPIs and screens appear automatically without coding new HMIs.

### Exponential Use Case Creation
Once data is structured and contextualized, new use cases emerge rapidly — predictive maintenance, energy optimization, quality analytics, AI applications.

### Extreme Flexibility
Systems evolve without re-engineering the entire architecture.

### Faster ROI
Projects become incremental, not monolithic.
Value is delivered continuously.

### Tool Agnosticism
You choose tools based on need, budget, and constraints — not because your architecture forces you.

#  Why Adoption Fails

Like Agile, or AI, many will claim compliance and expertise.

But:

* Adding a tool, a broker does not create a Unified Namespace.
* Streaming all data does not make it event-driven.
* Publishing chaos does not create structure.

UNS is:
* A mindset
* A discipline
* A long-term architectural commitment, backed by tools respecting UNS principles.

It requires governance.
It requires naming conventions.
It requires semantic modeling.
It requires cultural alignment between IT and OT.

It takes years to master, because it is a framework.

# Sign the Unified Namespace Manifesto
We invite:

* Industrial leaders
* System integrators
* Software vendors
* Architects
* Public institutions
* Educators

To align around shared principles.
To avoid unnecessary complexity.
To design systems that will still make sense in 20 years.
