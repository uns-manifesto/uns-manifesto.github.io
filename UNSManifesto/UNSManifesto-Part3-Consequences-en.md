#  The Consequences of Doing It Right

When correctly implemented, a Unified Namespace creates:

### A Global Single Source of Truth (SSoT)
A shared, real-time operational reality across IT & OT.
* **Real-Time Definition**: It represents the *last known value* in near real-time.
* **No Duplication**: It provides data *without duplication* and *without storing it* (no database in the UNS core; historians are separate).
* **Automatic HMI**: New KPIs and screens appear automatically without coding new HMIs.

### Exponential Use Case Creation
Once data is structured and contextualized, new use cases emerge rapidly — predictive maintenance, energy optimization, quality analytics, AI applications.

### Extreme Flexibility
Systems evolve without re-engineering the entire architecture.

### Faster ROI
Projects become incremental, not monolithic.
Value is delivered continuously.

### Tool Agnosticism
You choose tools based on need, budget, and constraints — not because your architecture forces you.
