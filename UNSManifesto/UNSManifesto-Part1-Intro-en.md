## Why a Unified Namespace Manifesto?

In 2001, the **Agile Manifesto** reshaped software development worldwide.
It was not a tool.
It was not a product.
It was not a standard.

It was a **set of principles**.

Today, industry, manufacturing, energy, logistics, and smart infrastructure need the same clarity.

The **Unified Namespace (UNS)** is not a product.
It is not a broker.
It is not a platform.

It is a **principle of architecture / design philosophy for industrial information systems** which goes beyond the boundaries of IT and OT, as it spans across the entire extended organization (various providers, public institutions, B2B/B2C customers, etc.) to deliver Data as high value-added.

Like agility, it is:

* Difficult to explain in theory, because it is vast
* Obvious once experienced (Maria Montessori's #LearnByDoing principle)
* Simple in principle
* Powerful in practice
* Easy to misunderstand
* Hard to master, and needs many years of hands-on fields experience (not theory)

You do not “install” a Unified Namespace.
You **design a Digital Strategy, and grow into it** over the years.
